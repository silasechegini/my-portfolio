            `I am a life long learner, an enthusiastic software developer with over 2+ years of experience with Web technologies,
            and I have participated in the complete
            product development lifecycle of successfully launched applications. I am eager to take up competitive 
            and challenging opportunities to deliver mission-critical technology and business solutions to Fortune 
            500 companies and some of the most recognized brands on the planet. In previous roles, I reduced downtime 
            by 15%; identified and resolved process bottlenecks that reduced coding efficiency by up to 30%.
            I like building awesome software. I could have used wordpress to build this website but i am not a big fan of drag and drop so, 
            I decided to get my hands dirty. I have built lots of single page web applications, corporate software
            and currently collaborating with my peers in the software development paradigm to build applications just for fun!
